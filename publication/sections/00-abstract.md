## Abstract

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent runtime environments has enabled a new class of software systems: declarative multi-agent systems (MAS), where agents are defined through natural language blueprints rather than compiled code. However, this nascent field lacks a shared vocabulary for design. This paper presents POMASA (Pattern-Oriented Multi-Agent System Architecture), a pattern language comprising 15 patterns organized into four categories: Core (COR), Structure (STR), Behavior (BHV), and Quality (QUA). Each pattern addresses recurring challenges in declarative MAS construction—from agent definition and coordination to quality assurance and hallucination prevention. We demonstrate POMASA through an industry analysis system that employs 8 agents to conduct systematic research, producing reports grounded in hundreds of verifiable sources. Beyond documenting patterns, this paper advances a key insight: for AI runtime environments, pattern languages themselves become executable. Unlike traditional patterns requiring human translation into code, POMASA patterns can be directly interpreted by AI systems to generate working implementations. This property transforms what "open source" means—publishing a pattern language becomes equivalent to releasing source code, as readers can present patterns to an AI system and reconstruct the architecture. We argue that pattern languages, originally designed for human knowledge transfer, prove remarkably suitable for AI interpretation, offering a promising approach to declarative MAS development.
